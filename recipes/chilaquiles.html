    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 fresh tomatillos</li>
        <li>1 white onion, coarsely choped</li>
        <li>1 poblano pepper, peeled and seeded</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>12 white corn tortillas, cut into 3 strips</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Blend tomatillos, onion, poblano pepper, jalape√±o pepper, cilantro, garlic, mint, and salt in a blender until smooth. Transfer mixture to a saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add chicken to tomatillo sauce and continue to simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tortilla strips in batches until crisp and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Layer about 1/2 of the fried tortillas in a 2-quart baking dish; spread 1/2 of the tomatillo sauce over tortillas. Mix pepper Jack cheese and Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese mix over tomatillo sauce. Repeat layers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool before serving, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
